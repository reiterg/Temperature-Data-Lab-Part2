% DESCRIPTION:

% INPUT:
%    staton_number: Number of the station from which to analyze historical temperature data
%    **Describe any other inputs you choose to include**

% OUTPUT:
%    baseline_model: [mean annual temperature over baseline period
%       (2006-2025); standard deviation of temperature over baseline period]
%    P: slope and intercept for a linear fit to annual mean temperature
%       values over the full 21st century modeled period
%   **list any other outputs you choose to include**

%% Read and extract the data from your station from the csv file
filename = ['model' num2str(station_number) '.csv'];
%Extract the year and annual mean temperature data
%<--

%% Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the annual mean temperatures
%  over the baseline period over the first 20 years of the modeled 21st
%  century (2006-2025) - if you follow the template for output values I
%  provided above, you will want to combine these together into an array
%  with both values called baseline_model
 %<-- (this will take multiple lines of code - see the procedure you
 %followed in Part 1 for a reminder of how you can do this)


%% Calculate the 5-year moving mean smoothed annual mean temperature anomaly over the modeled period
% Note that you could choose to provide these as an output if you want to
% have these values available to plot.
 %<-- anomaly
 %<-- smoothed anomaly

%% Calculate the linear trend in temperature this station over the modeled 21st century period
